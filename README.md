| Total Revenue           | **$9,708,245**   | Driven by high-margin accessories                |
| Top Region              | North America    | 70%+ of business — heavy geographic concentration |
| Core Customer           | Males, Age 50–70 | Dominant segment; females under-served           |
| Top Revenue Product     | Hitch Rack – 4-Bike | $21.2M from just 183 orders → high value         |
| Fastest Growing Period  | 2016 → 2017      | ~50% YoY revenue jump after mid-2016 dip         |
| Target Achievement      | Only **50%**     | Orders significantly below goal                  |

### Critical Business Questions Answered
- Sales grew strongly from 2015 to 2017, with a noticeable dip mid-2016 followed by a sharp rebound.
- North America dominates; Europe & Pacific represent clear growth opportunities.
- Accessories (especially bike racks and tires) generate disproportionate revenue vs. volume.
- Female customers and younger segments are under-represented → marketing opportunity.
- Company consistently misses order volume targets despite strong revenue.

### Conclusions & Strategic Recommendations
1. **Geographic Risk**: 70%+ revenue from North America → prioritize Europe/Pacific expansion.
2. **Gender Opportunity**: Females are 43% of orders but likely higher potential → launch targeted campaigns.
3. **Product Focus**: Double down on high-margin accessories (Hitch Racks, Tires & Tubes).
4. **Seasonality Leverage**: Capitalize on summer peaks (June–July) with promotions to close target gaps.
5. **Cloud Monitoring**: Deploy this dashboard to Power BI Service with scheduled refresh + alerts for real-time tracking.

### Highlights
- Built using **Power BI Desktop** + optimized for **Power BI Service (cloud)**
- Clean and modern UI with conditional formatting and tooltips
- Fully interactive slicers and cross-filtering
- Mobile-responsive layout tested
